# Binary Search Tree Implementation in C

A simple and efficient implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C that supports generic data storage.

## Features

- Generic data storage (void pointer)
- Binary Search Tree operations:
  - Insert node
  - Delete node
  - Search node
  - Find minimum/maximum values
- Tree traversal methods:
  - In-order
  - Pre-order
  - Post-order
- Memory management utilities
- Custom callback support for tree traversal
